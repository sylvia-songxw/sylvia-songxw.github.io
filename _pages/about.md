About Me
------
I am a 3rd year Master student at [SMART Lab](https://smart.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn) in ShanghaiTech University, fortunately supervised by Professor [Dengji Zhao](http://dengji-zhao.net). I major in Computer Science and Technology, and I have been especially focusing on Algorithmic Game Theory for the past three years.

Research Interests
------
People do strange things all the time. Sometimes, we may be stuck in a dilemma where no one can get the benefit. It is like a sudden wipe of mist when a simple theory can explain the reason beneath. Constructing such models and theories requires effort and countless failed attempts. But the final ‘click’ moment will bring a real thrill. I am always curious about how humans make decisions and interact with each other, and that is also why I chose to study algorithmic game theory, the interdisciplinary field of Computer Science and Economics, during my Master’s. I witnessed delicate rules (mechanisms / algorithms) and strategic behavior of agents in various games. Though theories are more like ways to explain weird phenomena, it is quite enough for curious people. 

During my Ph.D., I will keep following my curiosity and apply CS techniques to understand the world and ourselves. During the three-year Master’s training, I learned how to construct theoretical models and design algorithms to achieve desired properties. Besides, I am comfortable with coding (e.g., using programs to find desirable solutions and shed light on algorithm design) and become experienced with simulations and visualizing the results.

If given the opportunity, I would like to do behavioral experiments because most theoretical results are far from true. Different from the ideal rational theory, humans not only care about the actual outcome, properties like fairness, reputation, and intuitive prosocial behavior are also influencing their behaviors. Uncovering these human features is essential to make artificial systems become value-aligned and cooperate with humans smoothly.

**Actively Looking For Ph.D. Positions!**
